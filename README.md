This is the github-repository for a tool for estimation of expected values with errors for very large time series. The code does this by working in O(n)-time. There are implementations for:
- Python
- R
- C++
- Armadillo C++
After pulling a copy of the repository to your computer, you can inspect the code for the language of interest to you in directories of the same name. Benchmarks for the language of your choice are in the benchmark-directory. You can contact me with questions at king.oslo@gmail.com
