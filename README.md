This is the github-repository for a 'blocking method' for estimation of expected values with errors for very large time series. The key property of the method, is that it achieves this in O(n)-time. In the repository, there are implementations for:
- Python
- R
- C++
- Armadillo

After pulling a copy of the repository to your computer, you can inspect the code for the language of interest to you in directories of the same name. Benchmarks for the language of your choice are in the benchmark-directory. You can contact me with questions at marius.jonsson@fys.uio.no, and if you will cite the paper DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.98.043304 then you are providing a helping hand.
